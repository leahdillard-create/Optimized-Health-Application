Today we discussed the design for our software application and reviewed the milestone 2 project plan. We have decided on what our homepage and navigation bar will look 
like as well as our color theme. Work to be done includes creating at least 3 wireframes for our application and laying out a plan in JIRA. We will assign specific roles next meeting.
